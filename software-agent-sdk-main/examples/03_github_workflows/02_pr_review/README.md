# PR Review Workflow

This example demonstrates how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow for automated pull request reviews using the OpenHands agent SDK. When a PR is labeled with `review-this` or when openhands-agent is added as a reviewer, OpenHands will analyze the changes and provide detailed, constructive feedback.

## Files

- **`workflow.yml`**: GitHub Actions workflow file that triggers on PR labels
- **`agent_script.py`**: Python script that runs the OpenHands agent for PR review
- **`prompt.py`**: The prompt asking the agent to write the PR review
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file

## Features

- **Automatic Trigger**: Reviews are triggered when:
  - The `review-this` label is added to a PR, OR
  - openhands-agent is requested as a reviewer
- **Inline Review Comments**: Posts review comments directly on specific lines of code in the PR diff, rather than a single giant comment. This makes it easier to:
  - See exactly which lines the feedback refers to
  - Address issues one by one
  - Have focused discussions on specific code sections
- **Skills-Based Review**: Uses public skills from <https://github.com/OpenHands/skills>:
  - **`/codereview`**: Standard pragmatic code review focusing on simplicity, type safety, and backward compatibility
  - **`/codereview-roasted`**: Linus Torvalds style brutally honest review with emphasis on "good taste" and data structures
- **Complete Diff Upfront**: The agent receives the complete git diff in the initial message for efficient review
  - Large file diffs are automatically truncated to 10,000 characters per file
  - Total diff is capped at 100,000 characters
  - The agent can still access the repository for additional context if needed
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyzes code changes in context of the entire repository
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides structured review comments covering:
  - Overall assessment of changes
  - Code quality and best practices
  - Potential issues and security concerns
  - Specific improvement suggestions
- **GitHub API Integration**: Uses the GitHub API to post inline review comments directly on specific lines of code

## Setup

### 1. Copy the workflow file

Copy `workflow.yml` to `.github/workflows/pr-review-by-openhands.yml` in your repository:

```bash
cp examples/03_github_workflows/02_pr_review/workflow.yml .github/workflows/pr-review-by-openhands.yml
```

### 2. Configure secrets

Set the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

- **`LLM_API_KEY`** (required): Your LLM API key
  - Get one from the [OpenHands LLM Provider](https://docs.all-hands.dev/openhands/usage/llms/openhands-llms)

**Note**: The workflow automatically uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret that's available in all GitHub Actions workflows.

### 3. Customize the workflow (optional)

Edit `.github/workflows/pr-review-by-openhands.yml` to customize the configuration in the `env` section:

```yaml
env:
    # Optional: Use a different LLM model
    LLM_MODEL: openhands/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
    # Optional: Use a custom LLM base URL
    # LLM_BASE_URL: 'https://custom-api.example.com'
    # Optional: Choose review style ('standard' or 'roasted')
    # - 'standard': Pragmatic, constructive feedback (default)
    # - 'roasted': Linus Torvalds style brutally honest review
    REVIEW_STYLE: standard
```

### 4. Create the review label

Create a `review-this` label in your repository:

1. Go to your repository → Issues → Labels
2. Click "New label"
3. Name: `review-this`
4. Description: `Trigger OpenHands PR review`
5. Color: Choose any color you prefer
6. Click "Create label"

## Usage

### Triggering a Review

There are two ways to trigger an automated review of a pull request:

#### Option 1: Using Labels

1. Open the pull request you want reviewed
2. Add the `review-this` label to the PR
3. The workflow will automatically start and analyze the changes
4. Review comments will be posted to the PR when complete

#### Option 2: Requesting a Reviewer (Recommended)

1. Open the pull request you want reviewed
2. Click on "Reviewers" in the right sidebar
3. Search for and select "openhands-agent" as a reviewer
4. The workflow will automatically start and analyze the changes
5. Review comments will be posted to the PR when complete

**Note**: Both methods require write access to the repository, ensuring only authorized users can trigger the AI review.
