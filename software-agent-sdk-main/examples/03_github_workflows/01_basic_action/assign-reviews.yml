                # Issues with needs-info - Check for OP Response

                Find all open issues that have the "needs-info" label. For each issue:
                1. Identify the original poster (issue author)
                2. Check if there are any comments from the original poster AFTER the "needs-info" label was added
                3. To determine when the label was added, use: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/timeline
                   and look for "labeled" events with the label "needs-info"
                4. If the original poster has commented after the label was added:
                   - Remove the "needs-info" label
                   - Add the "needs-triage" label
                   - Post a comment: "[Automatic Post]: The issue author has provided additional information. Moving back to needs-triage for review."

                # Issues with needs-triage

                Find all open issues that have the "needs-triage" label. For each issue that has been in this state for more than 4 days since the last
                activity:
                1. First, check if the issue has already been triaged by verifying it does NOT have:
                   - The "enhancement" label
                   - Any "priority" label (priority:low, priority:medium, priority:high, etc.)
                2. If the issue has already been triaged (has enhancement or priority label), remove the needs-triage label
                3. For issues that have NOT been triaged yet:
                   - Read the issue description and comments
                   - Determine if it requires maintainer attention by checking:
                     * Is it a bug report, feature request, or question?
                     * Does it have enough information to be actionable?
                     * Has a maintainer already commented?
                     * Is the last comment older than 4 days?
                   - If it needs maintainer attention and no maintainer has commented:
                     * Find an appropriate maintainer based on the issue topic and recent activity
                     * Tag them with: "[Automatic Post]: This issue has been waiting for triage. @{maintainer}, could you please take a look when you have
                a chance?"

                # Need Reviewer Action

                Find all open PRs where:
                1. The PR is waiting for review (there are no open review comments or change requests)
                2. The PR is in a "clean" state (CI passing, no merge conflicts)
                3. The PR is not marked as draft (draft: false)
                4. The PR has had no activity (comments, commits, reviews) for more than 3 days.

                In this case, send a message to the reviewers:
                [Automatic Post]: This PR seems to be currently waiting for review.
                {reviewer_names}, could you please take a look when you have a chance?

                # Need Author Action

                Find all open PRs where the most recent change or comment was made on the pull
                request more than 5 days ago (use 14 days if the PR is marked as draft).

                And send a message to the author:

                [Automatic Post]: It has been a while since there was any activity on this PR.
                {author}, are you still working on it? If so, please go ahead, if not then
                please request review, close it, or request that someone else follow up.

                # Need Reviewers

                Find all open pull requests that:
                1. Have no reviewers assigned to them.
                2. Are not marked as draft.
                3. Were created more than 1 day ago.
                4. CI is passing and there are no merge conflicts.

                For each of these pull requests, read the git blame information for the files,
                and find the most recent and active contributors to the file/location of the changes.
                Assign one of these people as a reviewer, but try not to assign too many reviews to
                any single person. Add this message:

                [Automatic Post]: I have assigned {reviewer} as a reviewer based on git blame information.
                Thanks in advance for the help!
