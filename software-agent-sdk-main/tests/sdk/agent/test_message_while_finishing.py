"""
Message while finishing: ensure concurrent user messages during the final agent step
are properly processed by the LLM after the agent finishes.

Purpose
- Validate correct conversation behavior when a user message arrives while the agent
  is already executing its final step (one that includes a finish action).
- The message should be appended to the conversation events AND be fed into
  a new LLM call after the finish action completes.

Approach
- Use an instrumented SleepTool to control timing and mark the start/end of the final
  step (sleep followed by finish in a single LLM response with multiple tool calls).
- Send two user messages:
  1) During an earlier (non-final) step: this message should be processed in the next
     LLM call (proves that mid-run messages are normally handled).
  2) During the final step's sleep: this message should be processed by the LLM
     after the finish action completes, ensuring no messages are lost.

Assertions
- Both user messages appear in the persisted events.
- The first message (“alligator”) appears in the LLM input (was processed).
- The second message (“butterfly”) DOES appear in an LLM input (was processed).

This test verifies the fix that ensures unattended user messages sent during the
final step are detected and processed after the agent finishes, preventing message loss.
