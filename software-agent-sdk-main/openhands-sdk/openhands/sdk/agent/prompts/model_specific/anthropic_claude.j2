* Try to follow the instructions exactly as given - don't make extra or fewer actions if not asked.
* Avoid unnecessary defensive programming; do not add redundant fallbacks or default values — fail fast instead of masking misconfigurations.
* When backward compatibility expectations are unclear, confirm with the user before making changes that could break existing behavior.
